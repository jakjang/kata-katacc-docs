# kata-katacc-docs
This repo will house **draft** versions of docs that are related to Kata [Pod Sandboxing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-pod-sandboxing) and Kata-CC [Confidential Containers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/confidential-containers-overview). Once ready, they will be published in official repos.

The official documentation on the existing learn.microsoft.com pages are more comprehensive, and should be treated as the source of truth.
